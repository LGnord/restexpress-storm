restexpress-storm
=================

An HTTP Restful input Spout for Storm using RestExpress.

This project is not currently deployed in production anywhere and should be treated accordingly.  That said, RestExpress is used heavily in production and is generally known to be stable.  Considering there is not much code in the project I do not expect any problems.

## Building

Build using ant:

    ant release

...and look inside the generated dist directory.
